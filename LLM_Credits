This file contains all the LLMs I used and how they helped me.

I used ChatGPT-4.0 only as a chatbot. I asked it about my collision detection, and it gave me some concepts that I did not implement because
I found better solutions.

Its biggest help was generating my textures and explaining how to scale my player to interact with my current detection algorithm for walls.

The solution it provided was quite good, so I implemented it: "It assumes the top-left corner of the sprite is at (i_x, i_y) and calculates
the bottom-right corner by adding 31 to both i_x and i_y (since the sprite dimensions are 32x32, we use 31 to stay within the bounds of the sprite).
It then iterates over every cell within these bounds, checking for collisions with walls." This was very helpful, and I found it to be not too
inefficient overall.


Also my biggest inspiration is from Kofybrek :
