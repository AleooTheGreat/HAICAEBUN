This file contains all the LLM I used and how he helped me.

I used ChatGPT4.0 only as ChatBot. I asked him about my collision detection and he gave me some concepts that were not implemented because I found better solutions. 

His biggest help was generating my textures and explaining me how to scale my player to interact with my current detection algorithm for walls.

His solution was quite good so I implemented: "It assumes the top-left corner of the sprite is at (i_x, i_y) and calculates the bottom-right corner by adding 31 to both i_x and i_y (since the sprite dimensions are 32x32,
we use 31 to stay within the bounds of the sprite). It then iterates over every cell within these bounds, checking for collisions with walls. " This was very helpful and I figured out it is not that non-efficient overall.

Also my biggest inspiration is from Kofybrek :

https://github.com/Kofybrek - here he explains more about implementation and you can see his code.
